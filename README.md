- Easy usage with Discord command system (eg. ``/play``, ``/pause``, ...)
- Fast and validated configuration using environment variables
- Typesafe code for quicker development and less bugs

## ðŸ“Œ About this fork
This project was fork from [manual-rw on Github](https://github.com/manuel-rw/jellyfin-discord-music-bot/). I came across and interested in this project,
By the way, The many things is missing from that repo. So i made a fork and try to do my best to fit this bot to my use cases.

## â›” Limitations

- Bot does not support shards (for now). This means, you cannot use it in multiple servers concurrently.
- Album covers are not visible, unless they are remote (eg. provided by external metadata provider)
- Streaming any video content in voice channels (See [this issue](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/issues/4116))
